# discouraged-npm-packages
List of npm packages you should stop using.

Npm is full of junk that should best be avoided.
Some packages are discontinued and don't get any updates any more.
Some packages forget to deprecate themself and dose not provide you with any information of what you should use instead.
Some packages can even be harmful

This organisation is an attempt to help out fleshing this things out. 
I will attempt to make a plugin that can work with some certain build tools, such as a lint plugin or something that can scan package(-lock).json for any (dev)Dependency or sub dependency and provide you with a json db linking to the relevant topic

this list of discouraged npm packages is by no mean one sideded. The idea is for the ppl to vote on issues/packages to be disccuraged and if some ratio is meet then it will update the list of disccuraged npm packages
